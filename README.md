# Bubble game in JavaScript

<a href="https://student-piyushmishra.github.io/bubble-game-js/">View Live Demo!</a>

This repository showcases a simple beginner level JavaScript project in which I have tried my best to create a simple bubble game in which the user have to hit a number specified by the game and the hit number changes after every correct click. If the user clicks on the right number then the score increases and after 60 seconds the game resets.
